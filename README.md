#Contains a two layer ANN and a two convo-pooling layered CNN

# ANN:

#to get the various features of costumers of a hypothetical bank, and uses it to predict whether the costumer leaves or stays

#can be applied to equiavalent classification problem

## dataset Sorce: Superdatascience.com

# CNN:

#the classic CNN that classifies the image as a DOG or a CAT

## dataset Source : Superdatascience.com

*The CNN model was trained on 8000 images(equally for cats and dogs), and 2000 test images were tested. *

*Also, the data was neatly categorized into training set and test set, with the dogs and the cats seperated into folders*






### The CNN was found to be overfit for this classification task, so only one convo-pooling layer did a fine job of generalizing.
